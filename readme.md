# Practice your Dom-Manipulation skills!


- add a button to the page. When you click the button, the sum of the numbers in the array should be calculated and displayed on the page. At the moment the sum is displayed all the time on the page, but you need to change this!

- Try out: change the styling of your page using Dom-Manipulation. For this you can add another button and when you click on it, the style changes. For this you need to look into how to change (toggle) classes on an element using JS. 

In case you need some help with these exercises, check out the other branch `domExercises` of the project. There you find a more detailed description of the tasks and a tour of the code for each task. 
If you already have a local copy of this project, open it in your editor and download the lastest changes with `git pull` on the command line. Then you can switch to the branch with a `git checkout domExercises`.
